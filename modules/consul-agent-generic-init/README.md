## Generic Host Init for Consul Agents

The purpose of this module is to provide the `user_data` to init a new Host that
will be joining a network or SOA cluster built on Consul.

This module relies on the same assumptions as the other modules in this
repository (we're using saltstack for CM and to abstract away the details). Thus,
the `user_data` generated makes use of Saltstack, the platform's configuration
management formula and related abstractions.

The goals of this module are:

* make the code easier to read and maintain,
* make the ASG definitions more reliable and consistent,
* simplify the code that defines the environment as a whole

NOTE: need to update for template_file data type

### Example

```
# provisioning for worker cluster
module "worker-init" {
    source = "../modules/consul-agent-generic-init"
    datacenter = "${var.datacenter}"
    service = "worker"
    consul_secret_key = "${var.consul_secret_key}"
    consul_client_token = "${var.consul_master_token}"
    leader_dns = "${module.consul-leaders.leader_dns}"
    extra_pillar = "extra: pillar"
    extra_init = <<EOF
echo "customize this node's init.."
date
consul --version
salt-call --version
uname -a
EOF
}
```
