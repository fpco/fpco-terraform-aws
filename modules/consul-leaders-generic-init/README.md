## Consul Leader Init

**DEPRECATED** - This module will probably be removed in a future release.

Based on Saltstack, and boxed/packaged with quite a few assumptions. If you
need something more composable, see the `init-snippet-*` modules.

NOTE: deprecated, or should be written to use the relevnat init-snippet
modules.
