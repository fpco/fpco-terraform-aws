## Multi-Volumes (EBS)

Easily create multiple volumes from a comma-separated list of sizes.

This is currently limited to five volumes, but can be expanded by
adding more aws_ebs_volumes and aws_volume_attachments following
the established pattern.

NOTE: this module could be updated to support N number of volumes.

**TODO: REVIEW THE OTHER MODULES AND ASK THE ENGINEERS, IS THIS MODULE STILL IN USE?**
